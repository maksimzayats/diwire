   :description: Runnable example scripts for diwire, grouped by topic from basics to async and FastAPI integration.

Examples (runnable)
===================

All examples below are self-contained scripts.
You can:

- run most of them in your browser (click **Run** in the top-right of a code block)
- copy a block into a local ``.py`` file and run it with ``python``

The FastAPI examples are the main exception: they are not runnable in the browser.

Learning path
-------------

1. Basics (registration, lifetimes, constructor injection)
2. Scopes (SCOPED, generator cleanup, nested scopes)
3. Function injection (Injected marker)
4. Patterns (request handlers, repositories, interfaces)
5. Async
6. FastAPI
7. Errors (what failures look like)
