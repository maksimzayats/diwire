Generated DI resolver module.

Generated by: diwire.resolvers.templates.renderer.ResolversTemplateRenderer.get_providers_code
diwire version used for generation: 0.1.0.post43.dev0+b683984

Generation configuration:
- root scope level: 1
- managed scopes: app:1, session:2, request:3, action:4, step:5
- lock mode: async
- cleanup support enabled in graph: False
- provider count: 1
- provider slots: 1

Examples:
>>> root = build_root_resolver(registrations)
>>> service = root.resolve(SomeService)
>>> async_service = await root.aresolve(SomeAsyncService)
>>> request_scope = root.enter_scope()
>>> scoped_service = request_scope.resolve(RequestScopedService)
