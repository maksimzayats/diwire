Generation configuration:
- root scope level: 1
- managed scopes: app:1, session:2, request:3, action:4, step:5
- graph has async specs: True
- cleanup support enabled in graph: False
- provider count: 2

- async lock count: 0
- provider slots: 1, 2

Examples:
>>> root = build_root_resolver(registrations)
>>> service = root.resolve(SomeService)
>>> async_service = await root.aresolve(SomeAsyncService)
>>> request_scope = root.enter_scope()
>>> scoped_service = request_scope.resolve(RequestScopedService)

    This function rebinds module-level provider globals for the supplied registrations.
    Global rebinding makes `resolve_<slot>` methods run without registration lookups.
    Provider slots configured during bootstrap: 1, 2.
    Root resolver class: RootResolver.

    Examples:
    >>> root = build_root_resolver(registrations)
    >>> root.resolve(SomeService)
    >>> await root.aresolve(SomeAsyncService)
    >>> scoped = root.enter_scope()
